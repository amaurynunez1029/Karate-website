  <b>Makiwara</b>: <br>
  The makiwara is a age old symbol of karate. It is used to toughen up the hands. Punches, and similar strikes became much more powerful after proper use as instructed by a sensei. The makiwar is much like the punching bag of today except it is a much tougher surface to endure. Only after you have developed a good punching form should you start using this tool. <br>

  Weapons such at the nunchuks and the bo staff offer a new view to training which will help you become a more skilled fighter. Usually these are only introduced once you have mastered a few of the basics.
