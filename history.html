    <b>Karate</b>- The beggining starts with you. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    
    A dojo is always open. Many have been open for over 200 years. Every particular style is created through its founder and has its respective grandmaster. But you''re what matters when you comeinto the dojo. what you create with how you apply your time is what becomes history and can't be blurred from history. Unlike the lore of all karate which involves then uncertainty of its roots in china or japan. When you walk into class your name is entered intor your attendance folder making you participation etched in history so to speak. How you develope is a direct visual of what classes you have taken. Thats the true, unblurred history of karate. Whether you decide practice may involve your entry into tournmanets or just a new addition too your skill set belongs to you. (HIS-tory; HIS- men or woMEN)
    Karate is how you have absorbed the skills which become your arsenal. Which is also what any martial art intends to pass down to its practicioner.<br>
